# prediction_tools
Basic tools to predict patterns in semi-cyclic data

Goal: to cover useful tools in my experience:

    Fractal dimension measurements
    Rolling standard deviation and mean
    Basic cyclic measurement of data

Lesser Goal: to cover these tools (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series)

    Consideration of the autocorrelation function and the spectral density function (also cross-correlation functions and cross-spectral density functions)
    Scaled cross- and auto-correlation functions to remove contributions of slow components[32]
    Performing a Fourier transform to investigate the series in the frequency domain
    Use of a filter to remove unwanted noise
    Principal component analysis (or empirical orthogonal function analysis)
    Singular spectrum analysis
    "Structural" models:
        General State Space Models
        Unobserved Components Models
    Machine Learning
        Artificial neural networks
        Support vector machine
        Fuzzy logic
        Gaussian process
        Hidden Markov model
    Queueing theory analysis
    Control chart
        Shewhart individuals control chart
        CUSUM chart
        EWMA chart
    Detrended fluctuation analysis
    Dynamic time warping
    Cross-correlation
    Dynamic Bayesian network
    Time-frequency analysis techniques:
        Fast Fourier transform
        Continuous wavelet transform
        Short-time Fourier transform
        Chirplet transform
        Fractional Fourier transform
    Chaotic analysis
        Correlation dimension
        Recurrence plots
